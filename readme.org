#+TITLE: IUCN Conservation Data Analysis
#+AUTHOR: Manish Gadhvi

The aim of this project is to perform analysis on conservation data from the [[https://www.iucnredlist.org/][IUCN]]. The IUCN publishes data in relation to animal sightings. This culminates into their Red List which presents how vulnerable animals are based on a scale

They have kindly made their [[https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/spatial-data-download][observation spatial data]] available in the following formats:

#+begin_quote

1. Polygons in Esri shapefile format, containing the known range of each species. Note that sometimes the range is incomplete.

2. Points as a csv (comma separated value) table including the latitude and longitude of each observation.

3. Freshwater HydroBASIN Tables in csv format. Freshwater species are mapped to pre-defined river/lake catchment units called HydroBASINS. It is widely accepted that the river/lake catchment is the most appropriate management unit for inland waters. These species range tables contain the HydroBASINS ID field which can be joined to the HydroBASINS spatial data.

* Tooling
Initial analysis will be done using QGIS. This will then be automated using GeoPandas

* Data Filtering
The data set contains around 12,000 records. This project is only concerned with sighting data in the United Kingdom between 2020 and 2024 inclusive.

* Setup
The initial base layer for the project was created using [[https://www.openstreetmap.org][Open Street Maps]]. The IUCN shapefiles were then filtered based on the year and a new GeoPackage was created based on the filter
